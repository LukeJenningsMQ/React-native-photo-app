# React Native app (Memory Dump)
Build app using react native and used expo to view it. You are able to add photos to different categories and view the photos by their categories.

A video demonstration of this app can be found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiELDQy4lOo

This app was developed and designed with it being used on a IPhone 13 (IOS), so if you would want to try I recommend using an IOS device/simulator.

You are able to register a new account or you can login using a pre-existing account if preferred Username: ltj@g.com, Password: noise

Deleting photos can be done by swiping to the left in the collections screen.

Use these to try the app

```shell
npm install
```

```shell
npm start
```
